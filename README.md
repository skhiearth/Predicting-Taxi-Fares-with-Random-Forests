# Predicting-Taxi-Fares-with-Random-Forests

Working with the data from a large number of taxi journeys in New York from 2013, used regression trees and random forests to predict the value of fares and tips, based on location, date and time.

We also use spatial visualisation to get a better picture of the trends. 

The dataset used in this project is a sample from the complete 2013 NYC taxi data, which was originally obtained and published by Chris Whong.
