# Predicting-Taxi-Fares-with-Random-Forests

http://www.skhiearth.tech/Predicting-Taxi-Fares-with-Random-Forests/

Working with the data from a large number of taxi journeys in New York from 2013, used regression trees and random forests to predict the value of fares and tips, based on location, date and time.

I also used spatial visualisation to get a better picture of the trends. 

The dataset used in this project is a sample from the complete 2013 NYC taxi data, which was originally obtained and published by Chris Whong.
